**Study Session 2: Simplifying Algebraic Fractions**

Welcome back to Study Session 2! In the last session, we learned what algebraic fractions are and why it's important to know about restrictions on variables in the denominator.

In this study session, we're going to learn how to **simplify algebraic fractions**. Simplifying fractions makes them easier to work with and understand.

Before we start, remember the **"Prerequisites for the Unit: Algebraic Fractions"** list.  For this session, **factoring polynomials** is especially important.  Simplifying algebraic fractions heavily relies on your ability to factor expressions. If you need a refresher, now is a good time to quickly review factoring techniques like finding common factors, difference of squares, and factoring simple trinomials.

Let's get started with simplifying!

**1. Review: Simplifying Numerical Fractions**

Let's quickly remember how we simplify fractions with just numbers.  Consider the fraction **8/12**.

*(Insert a visual here - e.g., two bar diagrams of the same length, one divided into 12 parts with 8 shaded, and the other divided into 3 parts with 2 shaded. Or use pie charts. Label them "8/12" and "2/3").*

Look at the diagrams above. Both diagrams represent the same amount shaded, even though the fractions look different!  **8/12** and **2/3** are **equivalent fractions**.  They have the same value, but **2/3** is in **simplest form**.

**How do we simplify numerical fractions?**

We simplify by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their **greatest common factor (GCF)**.

For 8/12:

*   The factors of 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8
*   The factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
*   The greatest common factor of 8 and 12 is **4**.

So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4:

8/12 = (8 ÷ 4) / (12 ÷ 4) = **2/3**

**2/3** is the simplified form of 8/12 because 2 and 3 have no common factors other than 1.

**2. Simplifying Algebraic Fractions: The Process**

Simplifying algebraic fractions is very similar to simplifying numerical fractions!  Instead of dividing by the greatest common factor (GCF), we will **factor** the numerator and denominator and then **cancel** out any **common factors** that are algebraic expressions.

**Key Idea:** We **factor** to find common expressions that we can cancel.

Let's look at some examples.

**Worked Example 1: Simplifying (3x) / (6x)**

Simplify the algebraic fraction:  **(3x) / (6x)**

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify Common Factors:** Look for factors that are common to both the numerator (3x) and the denominator (6x).
    *   Both 3x and 6x are divisible by **x**.
    *   Also, 3 and 6 are both divisible by **3**.  In fact, 3 is the greatest common factor of 3 and 6.

2.  **Cancel the Common Factor 'x':**
    We can cancel the common factor 'x' from the numerator and the denominator:

    *(Show the cancellation visually, maybe by crossing out 'x' in both numerator and denominator in the expression  (3x) / (6x)  or using different colors).*

    **(3<s>x</s>) / (6<s>x</s>)  becomes  3 / 6**

3.  **Simplify the Numerical Part:** Now we have a numerical fraction 3/6. Simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their GCF, which is 3:

    3/6 = (3 ÷ 3) / (6 ÷ 3) = **1/2**

**Therefore, (3x) / (6x) simplifies to 1/2 (for x ≠ 0).**  We add the restriction *x ≠ 0* because if *x* were 0, the original denominator (6x) would be zero, and the fraction would be undefined.  However, for all other values of *x*,  **(3x) / (6x)** and **1/2** are equivalent.

**Worked Example 2: Simplifying (x² - 9) / (x + 3)**

Simplify the algebraic fraction: **(x² - 9) / (x + 3)**

**Steps:**

1.  **Factor the Numerator:** Look at the numerator, **x² - 9**.  Do you recognize this? It's a **difference of squares**!  We can factor it as:

    **x² - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)**

    *(Perhaps show the factoring step visually, expanding (x-3)(x+3) to verify it equals x² - 9)*

2.  **Rewrite the Fraction with Factored Numerator:** Substitute the factored form of the numerator back into the fraction:

    **(x² - 9) / (x + 3)  becomes  ((x - 3)(x + 3)) / (x + 3)**

3.  **Cancel the Common Factor (x + 3):**  Now we see a common factor of **(x + 3)** in both the numerator and the denominator. Cancel them out:

    *(Show the cancellation visually, crossing out (x+3) in both numerator and denominator in the expression  ((x - 3)(x + 3)) / (x + 3)  or using different colors).*

    **((x - 3)<s>(x + 3)</s>) / (<s>(x + 3)</s>)  becomes  (x - 3) / 1  which is just  (x - 3)**

**Therefore, (x² - 9) / (x + 3) simplifies to (x - 3) (for x ≠ -3).**  The restriction *x ≠ -3* is because if *x* were -3, the original denominator (x + 3) would be zero.  For all other values of *x*, **(x² - 9) / (x + 3)** and **(x - 3)** are equivalent.

**Important Note:** When we simplify algebraic fractions, we are finding an **equivalent fraction** that is in a simpler form.  The simplified fraction is equal to the original fraction for all values of the variable *except* for the restricted values that would make the original denominator zero.

**3. Factoring Review**

As you can see, **factoring** is a crucial skill for simplifying algebraic fractions!  You need to be able to factor the numerator and denominator to find common factors that can be canceled.
