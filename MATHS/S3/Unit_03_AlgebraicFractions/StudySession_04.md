**Study Session 4: Multiplying, Dividing, and Solving Equations with Algebraic Fractions**

Welcome to the final Study Session – Study Session 4! You've come a long way. You now know what algebraic fractions are, how to simplify them, and how to add and subtract them.  In this session, we'll learn how to **multiply** and **divide** algebraic fractions, and then, very importantly, how to **solve equations** that contain algebraic fractions – these are called **rational equations**.

As always, let's remember our **"Prerequisites for the Unit: Algebraic Fractions"** list. For this session, you'll be using *everything* you've learned in the previous sessions, especially your skills in **operations with numbers**, **simplifying algebraic fractions**, and **adding/subtracting algebraic fractions** (as these skills are needed to solve equations). Make sure you feel reasonably comfortable with those topics.

Let's finish strong and master these final operations and equation-solving techniques!

**1. Review: Reciprocals**

Before we dive into division, let's quickly review **reciprocals**. You'll need to understand reciprocals for dividing fractions.

**What is a reciprocal?**

The **reciprocal** of a number is simply **1 divided by that number**.  For a fraction, it's even easier: you just **flip the fraction** – swap the numerator and the denominator.

**Examples of Reciprocals:**

*   **The reciprocal of 2 is 1/2**  (because 1 ÷ 2 = 1/2)
*   **The reciprocal of 1/3 is 3/1, which is just 3** (because if you flip 1/3, you get 3/1)
*   **The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3** (just flip the fraction)
*   **The reciprocal of  'a/b' is 'b/a'** (in general, for any fraction)

**Quick Practice:**

What is the reciprocal of:

*   5?
*   1/7?
*   x/y?
*   (x + 2) / 3?

*(Pause for students to think or write down answers.  Provide the answers below or in a separate answer key)*

*(Answer Key: Reciprocals: 1/5, 7, y/x, 3/(x+2) )*

**2. Multiplying Algebraic Fractions**

Multiplying algebraic fractions is actually quite straightforward! It's very similar to multiplying numerical fractions:

**Rule:** To multiply algebraic fractions:

1.  **Multiply the numerators together.**
2.  **Multiply the denominators together.**
3.  **Simplify the resulting fraction, if possible.**  It's often easiest to simplify *before* multiplying if you can cancel common factors.

**Worked Example 1: Multiplying and Simplifying After**

Multiply:  **(x / 3) * (2 / y)**

**Steps:**

1.  **Multiply Numerators:**  x * 2 = 2x
2.  **Multiply Denominators:** 3 * y = 3y
3.  **Result:** Combine the products:  **(2x) / (3y)**
4.  **Simplify?** Can we simplify (2x) / (3y)? No, there are no common factors between 2x and 3y (other than 1).

**Therefore, (x / 3) * (2 / y) = (2x) / (3y)**

**Worked Example 2: Multiplying and Simplifying Before (Cross-Canceling)**

Multiply:  **((x + 1) / 2) * (4 / (x - 2))**

**Steps:**

1.  **Look for Common Factors to Cancel *Before* Multiplying:** Notice that the denominator of the first fraction (2) and the numerator of the second fraction (4) have a common factor of 2. We can simplify *before* multiplying:

    *(Show "cross-canceling" visually, perhaps by crossing out '2' and '4' and replacing them with '1' and '2' respectively in the expression  ((x + 1) / <s>2</s>) * (<s>4</s> / (x - 2))  or using different colors).*

    **((x + 1) / <s>2</s><sup>1</sup>) * (<sup>2</sup><s>4</s> / (x - 2))**

2.  **Multiply the Simplified Numerators:**  (x + 1) * 2 = 2(x + 1)
3.  **Multiply the Simplified Denominators:** 1 * (x - 2) = (x - 2)
4.  **Result:** Combine the products:  **(2(x + 1)) / (x - 2)**  (You can leave the numerator factored, or distribute the 2:  **(2x + 2) / (x - 2)** )
5.  **Simplify?** Can we simplify further? In this case, no.

**Therefore, ((x + 1) / 2) * (4 / (x - 2)) = (2(x + 1)) / (x - 2)  (or (2x + 2) / (x - 2))**

**3. Dividing Algebraic Fractions**

Dividing algebraic fractions uses a very important trick that you may remember from numerical fractions: **"Invert and Multiply"**.

**Rule:** To divide algebraic fractions:

1.  **Invert the second fraction** (the divisor) – find its reciprocal.
2.  **Change the division to multiplication.**
3.  **Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction** (using the multiplication rules we just learned).
4.  **Simplify the resulting fraction, if possible.**

**Worked Example: Dividing Algebraic Fractions**

Divide:  **(a / b) ÷ (c / d)**

**Steps:**

1.  **Invert the Second Fraction (c / d):** The reciprocal of (c / d) is **(d / c)**.
2.  **Change Division to Multiplication:**  **(a / b) ÷ (c / d)  becomes  (a / b) * (d / c)**
3.  **Multiply:** Multiply the fractions as we learned above:  **(a * d) / (b * c) = (ad) / (bc)**
4.  **Simplify?**  Check if (ad) / (bc) can be simplified. In general, without knowing more about a, b, c, d, we can't simplify further.

**Therefore, (a / b) ÷ (c / d) = (ad) / (bc)**

**Worked Example with Numbers and Variables:**

Divide:  **(x / 3) ÷ (y / 2)**

**Steps:**

1.  **Invert the Second Fraction (y / 2):** The reciprocal of (y / 2) is **(2 / y)**.
2.  **Change Division to Multiplication:**  **(x / 3) ÷ (y / 2)  becomes  (x / 3) * (2 / y)**
3.  **Multiply:**  **(x * 2) / (3 * y) = (2x) / (3y)**
4.  **Simplify?** No further simplification possible.

**Therefore, (x / 3) ÷ (y / 2) = (2x) / (3y)**

**4. Solving Rational Equations**

Finally, let's put everything together to learn how to **solve rational equations**.

**What is a Rational Equation?**

A **rational equation** is simply an equation that contains one or more **algebraic fractions**.

**Examples of Rational Equations:**

*   **(x / 2) + (1 / 3) = 5/6**
*   **(2 / (x - 1)) = 4 / x**
*   **(x / (x + 2)) = 3**

**The Strategy: Eliminate the Denominators!**

The main strategy for solving rational equations is to get rid of the fractions! We do this by **eliminating the denominators**.  We use the **Least Common Denominator (LCD)** to do this.

**Rule: Solving Rational Equations**

1.  **Find the Least Common Denominator (LCD)** of *all* the denominators in the equation.
2.  **Multiply *every term* in the entire equation by the LCD.** This will eliminate all the denominators.
3.  **Simplify** the equation after multiplying by the LCD.  The equation should now be free of fractions (it will likely be a linear or quadratic equation).
4.  **Solve the resulting equation** for the variable.
5.  **Check for Extraneous Solutions!**  This is VERY important.  **Always plug your solution(s) back into the *original* rational equation.**  Check if any solution makes any denominator in the original equation equal to zero. If it does, that solution is **extraneous** and must be discarded.

**Worked Example: Solving a Rational Equation**

Solve the equation:  **(x / 2) + (1 / 3) = 5/6**

**Steps:**

1.  **Find the LCD:** The denominators are 2, 3, and 6.  The LCD of 2, 3, and 6 is **6**.
2.  **Multiply Every Term by the LCD (6):** Multiply *every term* on *both sides* of the equation by 6:

    *(Show this step clearly, writing out 6 multiplied by each term:  6 * (x/2) + 6 * (1/3) = 6 * (5/6) )*

3.  **Simplify:** Cancel the denominators and simplify:

    **(6 * x / 2) + (6 * 1 / 3) = (6 * 5 / 6)**
    **(3x) + (2) = (5)**

4.  **Solve the Resulting Equation:** Now we have a simple linear equation:
    3x + 2 = 5
    Subtract 2 from both sides:  3x = 3
    Divide by 3:  **x = 1**

5.  **Check for Extraneous Solutions:**  Plug **x = 1** back into the *original* equation:
    **(1 / 2) + (1 / 3) = 5/6**
    Is this true?
    (3/6) + (2/6) = 5/6
    5/6 = 5/6  **Yes, it's true!**

    Also, check if x=1 makes any denominator in the *original* equation zero.  The denominators were 2, 3, and 6 – none of them contain *x*, so they can never be zero.

**Therefore, the solution to the equation (x / 2) + (1 / 3) = 5/6 is x = 1.**

**Worked Example with Variables in Denominators:**

Solve the equation:  **(2 / (x - 1)) = (4 / x)**

**Steps:**

1.  **Find the LCD:** The denominators are (x - 1) and x. The LCD is their product: **x(x - 1)**.
2.  **Multiply Every Term by the LCD (x(x - 1)):** Multiply both sides of the equation by x(x - 1):

    *(Show this step clearly:  x(x - 1) * (2 / (x - 1)) = x(x - 1) * (4 / x) )*

3.  **Simplify:** Cancel denominators:

    **(x<s>(x - 1)</s>) * (2 / <s>(x - 1)</s>) = (<s>x</s>(x - 1)) * (4 / <s>x</s>)**
    **(2x) = (4(x - 1))**

4.  **Solve the Resulting Equation:**
    2x = 4(x - 1)
    2x = 4x - 4
    Subtract 4x from both sides: -2x = -4
    Divide by -2:  **x = 2**

5.  **Check for Extraneous Solutions:** Plug **x = 2** back into the *original* equation:
    **(2 / (2 - 1)) = (4 / 2)**
    **(2 / 1) = (4 / 2)**
    **2 = 2  Yes, it's true!**

    Check for denominators becoming zero in the *original* equation.
    Denominator (x - 1) becomes (2 - 1) = 1 (not zero).
    Denominator x becomes 2 (not zero).
    So, x = 2 is a valid solution.

**Therefore, the solution to the equation (2 / (x - 1)) = (4 / x) is x = 2.**
