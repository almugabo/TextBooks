### Prerequisites:

Before starting this unit on Algebraic Fractions, you should be comfortable with the following topics:

*   **Basic Fractions:** Understanding numerators, denominators, equivalent fractions, and the concept of a fraction representing division.
*   **Variables and Expressions:**  Working with variables (letters representing numbers) and algebraic expressions (combinations of numbers, variables, and operations).
*   **Operations with Numbers:**  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of whole numbers, integers, and fractions.
*   **Solving Basic Equations:**  Solving simple linear equations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Factoring Polynomials (Basic):**  Being able to factor out a common factor, recognize and factor the difference of squares, and factor simple trinomials (like xÂ² + bx + c).
*   **Understanding Division by Zero:** Knowing that division by zero is undefined in mathematics.

*If you feel unsure about any of these topics, please review them before starting Study Session 1. You can find helpful resources online or in your previous math notes.*

*   **Materials Needed:**
    *   Digital worksheet (PDF or interactive form) with practice problems.
    *   Visual aids (diagrams of fractions, real-life examples as images).
    *   Notebook and pen/pencil.
    *   Links to videos
