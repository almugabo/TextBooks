4.  **Study Session 4: Multiplying, Dividing, and Solving Equations with Algebraic Fractions.** 

### Prerequisites:

Before starting this unit on Algebraic Fractions, you should be comfortable with the following topics:

*   **Basic Fractions:** Understanding numerators, denominators, equivalent fractions, and the concept of a fraction representing division.
*   **Variables and Expressions:**  Working with variables (letters representing numbers) and algebraic expressions (combinations of numbers, variables, and operations).
*   **Operations with Numbers:**  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of whole numbers, integers, and fractions.
*   **Solving Basic Equations:**  Solving simple linear equations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Factoring Polynomials (Basic):**  Being able to factor out a common factor, recognize and factor the difference of squares, and factor simple trinomials (like x² + bx + c).
*   **Understanding Division by Zero:** Knowing that division by zero is undefined in mathematics.

*If you feel unsure about any of these topics, please review them before starting Study Session 1. You can find helpful resources online or in your previous math notes.*

*   **Materials Needed:**
    *   Digital worksheet (PDF or interactive form) with practice problems.
    *   Visual aids (diagrams of fractions, real-life examples as images).
    *   Notebook and pen/pencil.
    *   Links to videos

### Study Sessions - outlines 

**Detailed Outline for Study Session 1: Introduction to Algebraic Fractions: Definition and Restrictions**

1.  **Introduction (Welcome and Unit Prerequisites)**
    *   Welcome to Study Session 1!
    *   Briefly mention the unit topic: Algebraic Fractions.
    *   Refer to the "Prerequisites for the Unit: Algebraic Fractions" list (previously defined).
    *   Encourage students to review prerequisites if needed.
2.  **Real-World Examples of Fractions (Activity & Discussion)**
    *   Present images showcasing fractions in real life (cooking, measuring, etc.).
    *   Pose questions to prompt reflection on the usefulness of fractions.
    *   Include a notebook activity: "Write down two ways you use fractions or see fractions used daily."
3.  **What are Algebraic Fractions? (Definition and Explanation)**
    *   Provide a clear definition of algebraic fractions.
    *   Explain numerator and denominator in the context of algebraic fractions.
    *   Use visual diagrams to illustrate examples (e.g., (x+2)/3, 5/(y-1), (a+b)/(c-d)), highlighting variables and expressions.
    *   Include a worked example, breaking down `(3x - 2) / (x + 4)` to identify numerator and denominator.
4.  **Identify Algebraic Fractions Exercise (Interactive Activity)**
    *   Describe the "Is it an Algebraic Fraction?" worksheet activity.
    *   List example expressions for the worksheet table.
    *   Explain the task: Classify each expression and provide a reason.
    *   Mention the availability of a self-check answer key.
5.  **Restrictions on Variables: Why They Matter (Explanation and Video)**
    *   Explain the concept of division by zero being undefined.
    *   Embed a link to a video explaining division by zero.
    *   Instruct students to watch the video and take notes.
    *   Connect division by zero to algebraic fractions and the concept of restrictions.
    *   Explain that restrictions are values that make the denominator zero.
6.  **Worked Example: Finding Restrictions**
    *   Use the example `2/(x-5)`.
    *   Step-by-step explanation of how to find the restriction `x ≠ 5`.
    *   Include a visual: Number line showing `x = 5` as a restricted value.
7.  **Practice Problems: Finding Restrictions (Self-Check)**
    *   Provide practice problems: `4/(3y+9)`, `a/(a^2-16)`, `8/(b+2)`.
    *   Instruct students to show their work in their notebooks.
    *   Mention the availability of a self-check answer key.
8.  **Self-Assessment: Check Your Understanding**
    *   List "Quick Check Questions" to assess learning:
        *   Definition of algebraic fraction.
        *   Why restrictions are needed.
        *   How to find restrictions for `7/(x-6)`.
    *   Provide a "Review" prompt, directing students back to specific sections if needed.
