**Study Session 3: Adding and Subtracting Algebraic Fractions**

Welcome to Study Session 3! In the previous sessions, you've learned what algebraic fractions are, how to find restrictions, and how to simplify them.  Now, we're going to learn how to **add** and **subtract** algebraic fractions.

Before we begin, let's quickly remember the **"Prerequisites for the Unit: Algebraic Fractions"** list. For this session, being comfortable with **operations with numbers** and understanding **basic fractions**, especially adding and subtracting numerical fractions, is essential.  Also, your **simplifying algebraic fractions** skills from Study Session 2 will be very important!

Let's learn how to combine algebraic fractions through addition and subtraction.

**1. Review: Adding and Subtracting Numerical Fractions**

Think back to adding and subtracting regular fractions with numbers.  Let's start with an easy example:

**Adding Fractions with Like Denominators:**

What is  **1/5 + 2/5**?

When fractions have the **same denominator** (like denominators), adding (or subtracting) is straightforward:

1.  **Keep the denominator the same.** (In this case, the denominator is 5).
2.  **Add (or subtract) the numerators.** (Here, 1 + 2 = 3).

So,  **1/5 + 2/5 = (1 + 2) / 5 = 3/5**

**Adding Fractions with Unlike Denominators:**

Now, what about  **1/2 + 1/3**?

These fractions have **unlike denominators** (2 and 3).  To add them, we need to find a **common denominator**.  The best common denominator to use is the **Least Common Denominator (LCD)**.

For 1/2 and 1/3, the LCD is **6**.  We need to rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 6:

*   **For 1/2:**  To get a denominator of 6, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 3:
    1/2 = (1 × 3) / (2 × 3) = **3/6**
*   **For 1/3:** To get a denominator of 6, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 2:
    1/3 = (1 × 2) / (3 × 2) = **2/6**

Now we have equivalent fractions with like denominators: **3/6 + 2/6**.  We can add them as before:

**3/6 + 2/6 = (3 + 2) / 6 = 5/6**

So, **1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6**

**Key Idea:** To add or subtract fractions with unlike denominators, you must first rewrite them with a **common denominator**, preferably the **Least Common Denominator (LCD)**.

**2. Adding and Subtracting Algebraic Fractions with Like Denominators**

Adding and subtracting algebraic fractions with **like denominators** is just like adding and subtracting numerical fractions with like denominators – it's the easiest case!

**Rule:** To add or subtract algebraic fractions with like denominators:

1.  **Keep the denominator the same.**
2.  **Add or subtract the numerators.**
3.  **Simplify the resulting fraction, if possible.**

**Worked Example 1: Adding with Like Denominators**

Add:  **(x / 7) + (3x / 7)**

**Steps:**

1.  **Like Denominators?** Yes, both fractions have a denominator of 7.
2.  **Keep the Denominator:** The common denominator is 7.
3.  **Add Numerators:** Add the numerators:  x + 3x = 4x
4.  **Result:** Combine the sum of the numerators over the common denominator: **(4x) / 7**
5.  **Simplify?** Can we simplify (4x) / 7?  No, there are no common factors to cancel (other than 1).

**Therefore, (x / 7) + (3x / 7) = (4x) / 7**

**Worked Example 2: Subtracting with Like Denominators**

Subtract:  **(5 / (y + 2)) - (1 / (y + 2))**

**Steps:**

1.  **Like Denominators?** Yes, both fractions have a denominator of (y + 2).
2.  **Keep the Denominator:** The common denominator is (y + 2).
3.  **Subtract Numerators:** Subtract the numerators: 5 - 1 = 4
4.  **Result:** Combine the difference of the numerators over the common denominator: **4 / (y + 2)**
5.  **Simplify?** Can we simplify 4 / (y + 2)? No, there are no common factors to cancel.

**Therefore, (5 / (y + 2)) - (1 / (y + 2)) = 4 / (y + 2)**

**3. Adding and Subtracting Algebraic Fractions with Unlike Denominators**

Now, let's tackle adding and subtracting algebraic fractions with **unlike denominators** – this is a bit more involved, just like with numerical fractions! We'll need to find the **Least Common Denominator (LCD)**.

**Rule:** To add or subtract algebraic fractions with unlike denominators:

1.  **Find the Least Common Denominator (LCD)** of the denominators.
2.  **Rewrite each fraction** as an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the denominator.
3.  **Add or subtract the numerators**, keeping the LCD as the denominator.
4.  **Simplify the resulting fraction, if possible.**

**Finding the LCD of Algebraic Denominators:**

To find the LCD of algebraic denominators, you often need to **factor** the denominators first.

**Example: Find the LCD of denominators  'x'  and  '(x + 1)'**

*   'x' is already in simplest form (like a prime factor).
*   '(x + 1)' is also in simplest form (it's a linear expression).

Since 'x' and '(x + 1)' have no common factors, their LCD is simply their product:  **LCD = x(x + 1)**

**Example: Find the LCD of denominators  '(x - 2)'  and  '(x + 2)'**

*   '(x - 2)' is in simplest form.
*   '(x + 2)' is in simplest form.

Again, no common factors, so LCD is their product: **LCD = (x - 2)(x + 2)**

**Example: Find the LCD of denominators  'x'  and  '2x'**

*   'x' is in simplest form.
*   '2x' can be thought of as 2 * x.

The factors are 2 and x.  The LCD needs to include all unique factors.  In this case, the LCD is **2x**.  (Notice that 2x is a multiple of both x and 2x).

**Worked Example 1: Adding with Unlike Denominators**

Add:  **(3 / x) + (2 / (x + 1))**

**Steps:**

1.  **Find the LCD:** The denominators are 'x' and '(x + 1)'.  We found earlier that their LCD is **x(x + 1)**.
2.  **Rewrite Fractions with LCD:**
    *   For **(3 / x)**: Multiply numerator and denominator by **(x + 1)**:
        (3 / x) = (3 * (x + 1)) / (x * (x + 1)) = **(3(x + 1)) / (x(x + 1))**
    *   For **(2 / (x + 1))**: Multiply numerator and denominator by **x**:
        (2 / (x + 1)) = (2 * x) / ((x + 1) * x) = **(2x) / (x(x + 1))**

3.  **Add Numerators:** Now we have like denominators. Add the numerators:
    (3(x + 1)) + (2x) = 3x + 3 + 2x = **5x + 3**

4.  **Result:** Combine the sum of the numerators over the LCD:  **(5x + 3) / (x(x + 1))**
5.  **Simplify?** Can we simplify (5x + 3) / (x(x + 1))?  In this case, no.  The numerator (5x + 3) cannot be factored further, and there are no common factors with the denominator.

**Therefore, (3 / x) + (2 / (x + 1)) = (5x + 3) / (x(x + 1))**

**Worked Example 2: Subtracting with Unlike Denominators**

Subtract:  **(5 / (x - 2)) - (4 / (x + 2))**

**Steps:**

1.  **Find the LCD:** The denominators are '(x - 2)' and '(x + 2)'.  Their LCD is **(x - 2)(x + 2)**.
2.  **Rewrite Fractions with LCD:**
    *   For **(5 / (x - 2))**: Multiply numerator and denominator by **(x + 2)**:
        (5 / (x - 2)) = (5 * (x + 2)) / ((x - 2) * (x + 2)) = **(5(x + 2)) / ((x - 2)(x + 2))**
    *   For **(4 / (x + 2))**: Multiply numerator and denominator by **(x - 2)**:
        (4 / (x + 2)) = (4 * (x - 2)) / ((x + 2) * (x - 2)) = **(4(x - 2)) / ((x - 2)(x + 2))**

3.  **Subtract Numerators:** Subtract the numerators:  **Be careful with subtraction!** Remember to distribute the negative sign to *both* terms in the second numerator.
    (5(x + 2)) - (4(x - 2)) = (5x + 10) - (4x - 8) = 5x + 10 - 4x + 8 = **x + 18**

4.  **Result:** Combine the difference of the numerators over the LCD: **(x + 18) / ((x - 2)(x + 2))**
5.  **Simplify?** Can we simplify (x + 18) / ((x - 2)(x + 2))? No. The numerator (x + 18) doesn't factor, and there are no common factors with the denominator.

**Therefore, (5 / (x - 2)) - (4 / (x + 2)) = (x + 18) / ((x - 2)(x + 2))**
